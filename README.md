# Best Practices: Convergence Testing 

In this brief morning lab session, we will go over best practices for solving partial differential equations numericall, with applications to the MESA Stellar Evolution Code.

The lecture slides can be found at [this repository, to be updated soon](https://broken-url.com). 

# Overview: 
When solving a partial differential equation numerically, at its essence, you are approximating a derivative 

$$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \approx \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y[i+1] - y[i]}{x[i+1] - x[i]}$$
